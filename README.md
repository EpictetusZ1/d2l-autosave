## D2L - Autosave Chrome Extension


## Every Accidentally Left an Assignment Feedback Page and Lost All Your Work?

Worry not! This Chrome Extension will automatically save your work as you type it.
The extension only runs on assignment feedback pages, and doesn't send any data to any server. It only saves your work locally on your browser.
It is safe to use and saves no personally identifiable information. 

### About

This Extension saves text as you write it in the feedback box of an assignment page. 
It saves the text every 2 seconds while typing, and you can see the last saved time at the bottom of the feedback box.

Once you submit the feedback the text is deleted from the local storage, or it will expire after 24 hours.
